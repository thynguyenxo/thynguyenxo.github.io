# Single price grid component - A Frontend Mentor challenge

In this challenge, I built out the pricing component to the designs provided on [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/single-price-grid-component-5ce41129d0ff452fec5abbbc).

Users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See a hover state on desktop for the Sign Up call-to-action
